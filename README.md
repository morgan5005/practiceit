These are the solutions to the exercises posted on https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/. I have included text files that describe the exercise as well as Java files that are the correct solutions. For several exercises there could be multiple solutions that worked. I solved these exercises during senior year of high school when I started learning Java in AP Computer Science. Practice-It is a great tool that is great for beginners in Java. This repo is a reference for others who are working on the exercises. The best way to learn how to solve these exercises and improve your knowledge in Java is through *practice*!
